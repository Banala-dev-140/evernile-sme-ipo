# Email Integration Guide

## Overview

The IPO assessment application now sends detailed reports via email instead of displaying them on screen. This provides a better user experience and ensures users receive a comprehensive report they can save and reference later.

## How It Works

### 1. User Flow
1. User completes the assessment (Mainboard or SME)
2. User fills in their contact details (name, email, phone)
3. User clicks "Generate & Email IPO Readiness Assessment Report"
4. System saves data to Supabase database
5. System opens email client with pre-filled report
6. User sees confirmation screen with summary

### 2. Email Content
The email contains:
- **Professional formatting** with Evernile branding
- **Complete assessment report** with all details
- **Readiness score and analysis**
- **Dynamic assessment points** based on responses
- **Next steps and contact information**
- **Call-to-action** to book a consultation

## Email Service Implementation

### Current Implementation (Mailto)
- Uses browser's default email client
- Pre-fills subject and body with report content
- Sends copy to `bdinesh@evernile.com`
- Works immediately without additional setup

### Production-Ready Implementation
The code includes a production-ready function `sendAssessmentReportViaAPI()` that can integrate with:
- **SendGrid**
- **AWS SES**
- **Mailgun**
- **Custom backend API**

  // Use your preferred email service
  const result = await emailService.send({
    to,
    from,
    subject,
    html,
    text

});
```
